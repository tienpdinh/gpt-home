A privacy-first conversational AI system for smart home control, designed to run entirely on edge hardware without cloud dependencies.

## üè† Overview

GPT-Home is a specialized ChatGPT-like system that provides natural language control for smart home devices through local language model inference. It operates entirely on a Raspberry Pi K3s cluster, ensuring privacy while demonstrating the feasibility of deploying sophisticated conversational AI on resource-constrained hardware.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Accept varied phrasings for device control
- **HomeAssistant Integration**: Direct REST API integration with your existing HA setup
- **Conversational Context**: Remember previous commands and maintain dialogue context
- **Privacy-First**: All processing occurs locally, no data leaves your network
- **Edge Deployment**: Optimized for Raspberry Pi 4B cluster with 4GB constraints
- **Kubernetes Ready**: Containerized deployment with K3s orchestration

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system consists of four primary components:

1. **Natural Language Processing Engine**: Runs quantized language models (TinyLlama/Phi-2)
2. **Device Integration Layer**: HomeAssistant REST API connectivity
3. **Context Management System**: Maintains conversation state and device references
4. **User Interface**: Web-based chat interface

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi 4B cluster with K3s installed
- HomeAssistant instance with REST API access
- Go 1.21+ (for development)
- Docker (for containerization)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:tienpdinh/gpt-home.git
   cd gpt-home
   ```

2. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your HomeAssistant URL and token
   ```

3. **Deploy to K3s**
   ```bash
   # Update deployments/k3s/configmap.yaml with your HA details
   ./scripts/deploy.sh
   ```

4. **Access the interface**
   - Add `gpt-home.local` to your `/etc/hosts` pointing to your K3s node IP
   - Visit `http://gpt-home.local`

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `SERVER_PORT` | HTTP server port | `8080` |
| `HA_URL` | HomeAssistant URL | `http://homeassistant.local:8123` |
| `HA_TOKEN` | HomeAssistant long-lived access token | Required |
| `LLM_MODEL_PATH` | Path to quantized model file | `./models/tinyllama-1.1b-chat-q4_0.bin` |
| `LLM_MODEL_TYPE` | Model type (tinyllama/phi2) | `tinyllama` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Logging level | `info` |

### HomeAssistant Setup

1. Create a long-lived access token in HA
2. Ensure REST API is enabled
3. Update the configuration with your HA URL and token

## üì° API Endpoints

### Chat
- `POST /api/v1/chat` - Send messages to the AI
- `GET /api/v1/conversations/:id` - Get conversation history

### Device Control
- `GET /api/v1/devices` - List all devices
- `GET /api/v1/devices/:id` - Get device details
- `POST /api/v1/devices/:id/action` - Control specific device

### System
- `GET /api/v1/health` - System health check

## ü§ñ Supported Commands

**Lighting**
- "Turn on the living room lights"
- "Dim the bedroom lights"
- "Turn off all lights"

**Climate**
- "Set temperature to 22 degrees"
- "What's the current temperature?"

**General**
- "What devices are available?"
- "Show me the status of all devices"
